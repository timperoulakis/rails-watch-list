He has always longed to travel but never had the opportunity in order to prevent rich skinflint Mr. Potter from taking over the entire town. All that prevents him from doing so is George's modest building and loan company, which was founded by his generous father. But on Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy loses the business's $8,000 while intending to deposit it in the bank. Potter finds the misplaced money and hides it from Billy. When the bank examiner discovers the shortage later that night, George realizes that he will be held responsible and sent to jail and the company will collapse, finally allowing Potter to take over the town. Thinking of his wife, their young children, and others he loves will be better off with him dead, he contemplates suicide. But the prayers of his loved ones result in a gentle angel named Clarence coming to earth to help George, with the promise of earning his wings. He shows George what things would have been like if he had never been born.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #21 | Nominated for 5 Oscars, 6 wins & 6 nominations total","directors":"Frank Capra","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001008","name":"Frank Capra"}],"writers":"Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, Frank Capra","writerList":[{"id":"nm0329304","name":"Frances Goodrich"},{"id":"nm0352443","name":"Albert Hackett"},{"id":"nm0001008","name":"Frank Capra"}],"stars":"James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore","starList":[{"id":"nm0000071","name":"James Stewart"},{"id":"nm0001656","name":"Donna Reed"},{"id":"nm0000859","name":"Lionel Barrymore"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000071","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIwNzMzODY0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk3NDQyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Stewart","asCharacter":"George Baileyas George Bailey"},{"id":"nm0001656","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAzNzA4MDc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU2ODU2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Donna Reed","asCharacter":"Mary Hatchas Mary Hatch"},{"id":"nm0000859","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5NzY5MTgwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjc4NjQ2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lionel Barrymore","asCharacter":"Mr. Potteras Mr. Potter"},{"id":"nm0593775","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTcwNjAwMDI2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNTUwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Thomas Mitchell","asCharacter":"Uncle Billyas Uncle Billy"},{"id":"nm0871287","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAxOTA4ODA1MTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDY1MTAwMjg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Henry Travers","asCharacter":"Clarenceas Clarence"},{"id":"nm0094135","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyODAzNTIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEwNjk5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Beulah Bondi","asCharacter":"Mrs. Baileyas Mrs. Bailey"},{"id":"nm0269709","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzODQ1Njk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkwMTM2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Frank Faylen","asCharacter":"Ernieas Ernie"},{"id":"nm0000955","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxNDA1Nzk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2NDQyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ward Bond","asCharacter":"Bertas Bert"},{"id":"nm0002108","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyNTgyNjMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgwMTM2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gloria Grahame","asCharacter":"Violet Beckas Violet Beck"},{"id":"nm0912478","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM1Mjc2NjgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM4NDYwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"H.B.
